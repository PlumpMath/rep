= rep

A single-shot nREPL client designed for shell invocation.

== Installation

Download the latest MacOS binaries from the GitHub releases tab above.

== Building with Graal

This is a somewhat graaling process right now, so bear with me.

At the moment, Graal doesn't deal well with the way Clojure generates bytecode
from its 'locking' macro, so to build bytecode that Graal can handle, we need
to apply https://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/attachment/18767/clj-1472-3.patch[this patch].
This issue is being tracked
https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1472[here] and
https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/861[here].

After applying the patch and invoking 'mvn install' for Clojure, you will need
to clone, build, and install 'spec.alpha' with that version of Clojure.

When that's done, you can update the versions of Clojure and spec.alpha
referenced in the project.clj to match the snapshots you've just locally
installed.

Assuming you've already installed Graal VM and put it in the path, you should
then be able to build the image:

  $ lein native-image

You will find it in 'target/default+uberconf/rep'.
